# ListMakingApplication

## Features the List Making Application implements:


1. The program can store one or more lists of items.


2. Each list has a name or label, and items in a list.


3. These items might include text, an URL, or an image.


4. Item lists can be created, deleted, or renamed, and viewed.


5. Items in a list can be viewed, added, deleted, or edited.


6. An item in a list can also be a link to another list of items, making it possible to have
lists of lists.


7. A search can be used to find and display items in any list that match the search
criteria.


8. Lists are automatically saved to a file, so that the user does not have to explicitly load
or save to a file. When a list or items are modified the change(s) are immediately
written to a file.
